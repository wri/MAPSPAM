Dear Rutger,

I can see your “problem” with matching our SPAM2010 codes and FAO’s code listing in the document whose link you sent. That is “the Indicative Crop Classification (ICC) has been developed for the 2010 round of agricultural censuses”, as FAO writes.

The classification from FAO can be found in the columns “item code” and “item” when you download FAOSTAT data.

A faster way is clicking on the type of data you want to download (in our case Crops), and then going to the bottom of the page where it says “Definitions and …”.
When you click there and select “item”, it produces a long list with FAOSTAT item codes (the ones we use for the matching exercise), but also other codes.
I have attached this list for your convenience. If you sort it by item-code you will get the crops nicely grouped by crop types (cereals, roots and tubers, …)

When you select a different domain (eg livestock), the item list will be different.

This sub-page is also useful to see which crops are grouped into a higher classification (eg cereals-rice milled equivalent, oilcrops, …), but also what factors are used to convert crops into the higher classification (eg rice paddy into cereals-rice milled equivalent).

FAOSTAT has a treasure trove of information, not always easy to find.

Cheers,

Ulrike
